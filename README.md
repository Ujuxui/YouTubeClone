## Summary
**In this YouTube app clone, 
I ensured proper implementation of user registration, JWT-based login, and sign-in functionality; 
checked for the functioning video player, comment management, and interactive buttons (like/dislike); 
evaluated the user's ability to create, edit, and delete; assessed the routing and functionality for users, videos, and comments, ensuring best practices are followed; 
checked how well the data is stored and retrieved, including 
video metadata, user info, comments, and channel details; 
and also ensured responsiveness.**
